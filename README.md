![The Risk Analysis Framework for Tropical Cyclones](/assets/img/raft_logo_header.jpg)

The **R**isk **A**nalysis **F**ramework for **T**ropical Cyclones (RAFT) is a unified framework capable of efficiently simulating millions of synthetic tropical cyclones (TCs; also known as hurricanes or typhoons) and their impacts, enabling robust probabilistic risk assessment.

RAFT consists of several different components that are coupled into one cohesive system. It utilizes established physical and statistical methods, while custom machine learning and AI approaches have been developed for more challenging and novel tasks. The summary of capabilities below is intended as a high-level overview; we refer interested readers to the referenced publications for technical details.

# The Framework

RAFT is a collection of models and tools written in Python, which when combined can simulate large numbers of TCs which are both realistic and physically consistent with the large-scale atmospheric forcing conditions.

## Synthetic TC Model

### Input Forcings
RAFT is forced with large-scale environmental conditions, which can be extracted either from observations or atmospheric models. Instead of trying to predict exactly what storms would form in a given environment, it simulates plausible storms that are consistent with the characteristics of that environment.

### Genesis and Track
Storm seeds are created by randomly sampling from the smoothed spatio-temporal distribution of historical TC genesis. Although the global rate of genesis seeding is nominally fixed, the intensity model described later may choose to decay these seeds before they develop, effectively modulating genesis frequency based on the favorability of the environment.

    alt="A random sample of synthetic TCs generated by RAFT"
    style="width: 70%"
  >
</div>

<!-- > _Animation of sampled genesis points from RAFT_ -->

These seeds are then propagated with the beta-advection method, which at its most basic means that the storms are blown by the large-scale prevailing winds. The beta-advection technique was initially described by Emanuel et al. ([2006](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-87-3-299)), with an improved beta scheme as described in Xu et al. ([2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-02952-7)). Note that these tracks are NOT simply perturbations of historical events, but entirely new storms (yet physically realistic) that in some cases have never been seen before.

### Intensity
Storm intensity is modeled with a deep learning neural network developed for this framework. Xu et al. ([2021](https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-20-0104.1)) details the methodology, and finds that the model is competitive with&mdash;and even occasionally outperforms&mdash;operational TC intensity forecasts.

### Projecting into the Future
Because RAFT does not require high-resolution forcings, it can be forced with lower-resolution future climate simulations such as those from the CMIP6 project. This enables the projection of TC behavior into the future under various different scenarios. This methodology is described and explored by Balaguru et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adf0259)), who find substantially increasing coastal hurricane risk in the U.S. in the SSP5-8.5 scenario.

## Hazard Models

Once an ensemble of TCs have been created, RAFT can assess a variety of impacts. Because of the significant sample size of TCs that RAFT generates (tens-of-thousands to millions), this enables the estimation of very rare impacts (e.g. 1-in-500-year events) that would otherwise be very difficult to model or observe.

### Rainfall
There are two rainfall models in this repository:
- TCR is a physics-based rainfall model described in Lu & Lin et al. ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1002/2013GL058284)). Our implementation is described in Xu et al. ([2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-02952-7)).
- PHRaMM is a physics-based rainfall model described in Kim et al. ([2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-022-00308-9)). We have found TCR to perform better overall, so this component may be out of date.

A deep learning AI rainfall model is currently in development.

### Storm Surge (DeepSurge)

Storm surge hazards are one of the most dangerous impacts from TCs, yet traditional surge models are often computationally expensive. To handle such large ensembles as generated by RAFT, we developed an AI storm surge model called DeepSurge. The first version of this model is described in Rice et al. ([2025](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/adfd74)), while a second version is in development.

### Electric Power Grid Impacts

A generalized power outage model, the Electric Power Outages from Cyclone Hazards (EPOCH) model, described in Rice et al. ([2025](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/adad85)), was developed to assess the risk posed by RAFT-simulated TCs to the electric grid. Development of this model is actively ongoing.

RAFT can also be used to assess the hazard posed by TCs to other energy infrastructure, such as wind turbines. This method was used to quantify future changes in hazard along the U.S. coastline in Lipari et al. ([2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01887-6)).
